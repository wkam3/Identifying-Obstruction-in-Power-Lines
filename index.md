# SDG&E Identifying Power Line Obstructions

## Introduction

## Overview
This project leverages advanced computer vision models to automatically detect and classify obstructions near SDG&E power lines. By analyzing visual data, the system aims to identify potential hazards like vegetation encroachment and damaged equipment before they can cause infrastructure damage or trigger wildfires. This proactive approach enhances grid reliability and public safety through early detection of risks.



## Detailed Analysis



## Data Sources
- SDG&E Infraction Reports (2020-2024)
- Equipment maintenance records
- Risk assessment documentation
